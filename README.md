# capital_stranding_cascades
This repository contains the code and material for:
Cahen-Fourot, L., Campiglio, E., Dawkins, E., Godin, A., and Kemp-Benedict, E. (2019) 
"Capital stranding cascades: The impact of decarbonisation on productive asset utilisation"

The main file is "Capital stranding cascades.R". It requires the installation of R (https://cran.r-project.org/). 

The code requires additional data and files: 
- IO and capital stock data from Eurostat (in the "country_data" folder)
- A library of functions ("capital_stranding_cascades_function_library", in the "files_to_load" folder)
- Data extracted from the Exiobase database ("fossil.prod.ratio.Rda", "fossil.use.ratio.Rda", "B_domestic_production.csv", in the "files_to_load" folder)

The "Exiobase folder" contains the code to extract the required data from the Exiobase database. The Exiobase database, however, is not included. To run the code, please download the Exiobase 3 database, available at www.exiobase.eu.
